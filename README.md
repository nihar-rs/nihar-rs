🧑🏽‍💻 Dev with a soft spot for clean and fast workflows. I build tools, tinker with vim, and occasionally dive into game dev worlds.

💾 Currently working on a pixel-art platformer game, optimizing my dotfiles, and living in the command line.

- 🔭 Exploring more of Linux, Neovim, Rust and Lower level stuff in General.
